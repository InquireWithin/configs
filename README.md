# configs
personal config files for anything I use and configure enough to warrant it. MANY THINGS HERE COULD BE UNFINISHED, OUTDATED, UNTESTED, OR BROKEN.

I'm aware that many of these dont use "best practice" as thats not their intent. The intent is to provide a repo of settings configurations for various platforms. Some of these are made on the fly.
